# A function which has no name, is known as lambda function

# This is also known as anonymous function

# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression

# syntax  (lambda arguments: expression)

# x = lambda a : a + 10
# print(x(5))
#
# x = lambda  a,b : a * b
# print(x(5,6))
#
# x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c
# print(x(5,6,2))
